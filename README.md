This project was to create a prototype of facebook website. Users could do all basic function of facebook website such as creating profile, Sending, receiving and approving or rejecting friend requests, Creating and managing groups, News Feed, Posting Interests etc.
This website is developed as a RESTFUL web service. I utilized Node.js, Angular.js, Bootstrap and MYSQL to develop this website. Also used connection pooling to enhance performance.
